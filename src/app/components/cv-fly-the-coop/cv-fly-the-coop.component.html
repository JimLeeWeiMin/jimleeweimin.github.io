                    This project is completed in a span of two semesters in Digipen. The first semester, GAM300, was used to construct a game engine on from scratch and the second semester, GAM350, is to put the game into the engine.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is done using Visual Studio with Win32 API as its base and OpenGL as its Graphics Library. The importation of 3D model and animation was done with the assistant of 'Assimp' library.<br>
